Quick and dirty maze generator that uses brownian motion to draw dead ends and
fake/random corridors.

maze_gen -w -h -d -solid

-w	width of the maze

-h	height of the maze

-d	density: sets the number of corridors that make up the path from the
	start to the exit. Also used to set the number of dead end paths.

-solid	solid: sets if the maze will try to remove some of the walls grouped
	together or not.
